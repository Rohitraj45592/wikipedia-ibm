      <div id="history" class="section active">
            <p><strong>International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)</strong>, originally known as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), was founded in 1911 through a merger of four companies. It was renamed IBM in 1924. Throughout the 20th century, IBM transformed the computing industry. It developed punch-card machines, magnetic stripe cards, and led the development of modern barcodes. IBM introduced the first automated teller machines (ATMs) and revolutionized data processing with the launch of the System/360 mainframe in the 1960s. During the 1980s, IBM became known for its personal computers, helping to define the PC industry as we know it today. Its ThinkPad laptops, acquired later by Lenovo, were once industry leaders.</p>
            <p>IBM also made strides in artificial intelligence, most notably with Deep Blue—the first machine to defeat a world chess champion—and later with Watson, which won the quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011. The company has consistently invested in research and development and has earned the highest number of U.S. patents every year for nearly three decades. With a shift towards cloud computing and AI in recent years, IBM acquired Red Hat in 2019, one of the largest software acquisitions in history. Its focus today lies in hybrid cloud infrastructure, enterprise AI, and quantum computing. IBM continues to influence the world through innovation, partnerships, and solutions designed to make businesses smarter, more secure, and resilient in an ever-changing world.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="corporate" class="section">
            <p>IBM's corporate affairs encompass a wide range of strategic operations that define its influence and longevity in the tech world.
